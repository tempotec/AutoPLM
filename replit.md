# Overview

This is a Flask-based technical specification management platform designed for fashion/textile industry workflows. The system allows users to upload PDF files containing technical specifications (fichas técnicas) and uses OpenAI's API to extract structured information through OCR processing. The platform features role-based access with admin controls for user management and comprehensive tracking of all user activities.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Font Awesome icons for enhanced user experience
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF for secure form handling with CSRF protection
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for PDF uploads with client-side validation

## Backend Architecture
- **Web Framework**: Flask with modular route structure
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database abstraction and relationship management
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with password hashing using Werkzeug
- **File Processing**: PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction combined with OpenAI API for intelligent data parsing
- **Security**: CSRF protection, secure filename handling, and file size limits

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: SQL database (configured via DATABASE_URL environment variable)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem storage for uploaded PDF files
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions for user state management

## Authentication and Authorization
- **User Roles**: Two-tier system with regular users and administrators
- **Access Control**: Decorator-based route protection (@admin_required)
- **Password Security**: Werkzeug password hashing for secure credential storage

## External Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-based text analysis for extracting structured data from PDF content
- **Database**: SQL database connection via SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
- **Environment Variables**: SESSION_SECRET for session security, OPENAI_API_KEY for AI processing

The system processes technical specifications containing product identification, commercial information, delivery schedules, team assignments, materials, and technical measurements. The AI integration transforms unstructured PDF content into structured database records with fields for reference codes, descriptions, collections, suppliers, pricing, and detailed technical measurements.
